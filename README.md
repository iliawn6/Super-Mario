# Evolutionary Algorithm for Super Mario Level Solvability

This repository contains a Python project that applies an evolutionary algorithm to determine solvability of various levels in the Super Mario game. Additionally, for levels that are solvable, the algorithm calculates the maximum possible points that can be earned by a player.

## Project Description

The project uses an evolutionary algorithm to assess and solve predefined levels of Super Mario. Each level's solvability is tested, and if a level is deemed solvable, the algorithm also estimates the maximum points achievable. This dual capability helps in understanding the difficulty and potential of each level from a computational perspective.

## Key Features

- **Level Solvability**: Determine if a Super Mario level can be completed.
- **Point Calculation**: Estimate the maximum points that can be obtained for solvable levels.
- **Visualization**: Use matplotlib to visually represent the results of the algorithm's analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the evolutionary algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used in Python for visualizing the results in a graphical format.
